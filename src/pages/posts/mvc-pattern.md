The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a software architecture design pattern that separates the representation of information from the user's interaction with it. This separation of concerns helps to improve the flexibility and maintainability of a software system.
<br/>
<br/>
The MVC pattern is made up of three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.
<br/>
<br/>
The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It is the source of truth for the application's state, and it provides methods for retrieving and modifying this data. The model does not depend on the other components of the MVC pattern, so it can be used in other parts of the application as well.
<br/>
<br/>
The view is responsible for presenting the model's data to the user. It is typically implemented as a user interface, such as a web page or a graphical user interface. The view has no knowledge of the model and receives updates from the controller.
<br/>
<br/>
The controller is the link between the model and the view. It receives user input and translates it into actions that the model or the view can understand. The controller updates the view when the model's state changes, and it updates the model when the user interacts with the view.
<br/>
<br/>
The MVC pattern provides several benefits to developers. First, it makes it easier to manage the complexity of a large application by dividing it into smaller, more manageable components. Second, it allows different developers to work on different components of the application concurrently, improving the efficiency of the development process. Third, it allows different views to be used for the same model, improving the flexibility of the application.
<br/>
<br/>
In summary, the MVC pattern is a widely used software architecture design pattern that helps to improve the flexibility and maintainability of a software system by separating the representation of information from the user's interaction with it.
