<br/>
<br/>
Hey there.

<br/>
<br/>

What are you doing here so late?
<br/>
<br/>

Can't sleep?

<br/>
<br/>


Ah. Coming to cry in the middle of the night.
<br/>
<br/>

I get that.
<br/>
<br/>

It feels nice to do that, so I understand.

<br/>
<br/>
Take all the time you need.

<br/>
<br/>

You know, I just happened to find you stumble upon this blog where I'm taking a break.

<br/>
<br/>

Wanna sit down for a while?
<br/>
<br/>

Tell me about what's bothering you?
<br/>
<br/>

Oh, don't worry about me. I don't find you annoying.

<br/>
<br/>
I wanna be here for you.

<br/>
<br/>

I'll try to help as best as I can.

<br/>
<br/>

I won't judge you. Everyone has their own story.

<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Ah, that sucks.

<br/>
<br/>

I can't begin to imagine how you must feel.

<br/>
<br/>

You're so tough for getting through all of that.

<br/>
<br/>

I'm so proud of you for not giving up.

<br/>
<br/>

Of course I understand.
<br/>
<br/>

One broken soul to another.

<br/>
<br/>

I just want to remind you.
<br/>
<br/>
No matter how hard it gets, please stay strong.

<br/>
<br/>
Take care of yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
You can't go into a battle already wounded.
<br/>
<br/>

You can't wave the white flag without trying your hardest.

<br/>
<br/>

This will all be over soon.

<br/>
<br/>


And hey.
<br/>
<br/>
If you ever need to take another break, I'm always here.
<br/>
<br/>

Helping people is my specialty.
<br/>
<br/>
They always find their way, one way or another.
<br/>
<br/>
You can come sit down with me any time.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to lend some advice, or just an ear to listen.
<br/>
<br/>
And if this is your last time visiting me, I'm proud of you.
<br/>
<br/>
My job is done.
<br/>
<br/>
Go take on life with all your energy, and remember that you have one soul always cheering you on.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll always have my support.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to see the great things you'll achieve.
<br/>
<br/>
Before you go...

<br/>
<br/>

I love you. <3
